# RBMvsVAE
Here you will find a notebook where I build a restrictive Boltzmann machine from scratch and we compare it to a VAE on the famous databases mnist and fashion_mnist . 

A RBM is type of artificial neural network used in machine learning, particularly in the field of unsupervised learning. RBMs belong to the broader class of probabilistic graphical models. Basically, it is learning a distribution proabilitites over the data to generate new ones.

VAE stands for Variational Autoencoder. It is a type of artificial neural network used for generative modeling and dimensionality reduction. VAEs belong to the family of autoencoder models, which are a type of neural network designed to learn representations of data.

Feel free to use the notebook and mention me if you do :) thx.
